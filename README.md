## Vision
Idea to product - it's all about the vibes, bro.

Bropilot transforms application development from code-first to concept-first, enabling users to build self-aware applications that understand their own structure and can evolve through AI collaboration. The system treats documentation as executable specification and generates code as the implementation of that specification.

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Description**: Applications contain complete knowledge of their own structure and behavior
2. **Bidirectional Truth**: Changes flow seamlessly between documentation and code
3. **Flow-Centric**: Applications are understood through the flows they enable, not just their components
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity is revealed only when needed
5. **AI-Native**: Structured for optimal AI comprehension and modification

## System Architecture

### Three-Layer Model

1. **Genome Layer**: Abstract description of what the application is and does (knowledge graph as source of truth)
2. **Proteome Layer**: Concrete implementation in code (generated from genome specifications)
3. **Phenome Layer**: Running application serving users (deployed and measured)

## Project Structure

```
bropilot/
├── src/
│   ├── types.ts      # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── database.ts   # SQLite operations  
│   ├── processor.ts  # AI processing engine
│   └── cli.ts        # CLI interface
├── schema.sql        # Database schema
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Key Features

- **Language Agnostic**: SQLite database, generates code in any language
- **Reusable Core**: Same logic works for CLI and web UI
- **Self-Improving**: Use Bropilot to build better Bropilot
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and excellent tooling
- **Single Binary**: Can package with `pkg` or `nexe` if needed

## Development

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Test
npm test
```

## Architecture

The core is designed for reuse:

- `BropilotDatabase`: All SQLite operations
- `ProcessingEngine`: AI workflow orchestration  
- `BropilotCLI`: CLI interface using the core
- `AIProvider`: Pluggable AI integration

This same core can power:
- CLI tool (`bro` command)
- Web interface (import and use classes)
- VS Code extension (reuse database and processing)
- Desktop app (Electron with same code)

## Self-Bootstrap Process

1. **Manual Setup**: Create initial implementation (this code)
2. **Self-Host**: Use `bro init bropilot` to manage Bropilot's development
3. **Self-Improve**: Add features by chatting with Bropilot about what it should become
4. **Meta-Development**: Bropilot generates code to improve itself

The goal: Bropilot becomes increasingly sophisticated by using its own conversation-to-code pipeline to evolve.
